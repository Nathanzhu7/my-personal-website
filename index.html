                <p>Today is May 8th, 2025 (for me right now). I woke up pretty late this morning and decided to back to sleep. Around 10:50am, I decided to get up. I know it was exactly 10:50am because
                    I had a group meeting with my software construction project group at 10:55am. I was late to that.
                    The project we're working on in software construction is pretty hard, so I decided to procrastinate by working on something else that wasn't as hard,
                    so I still felt like I was getting stuff done. That something else was making this website.
                    I had wanted to make one for a while, but swimming on the varsity team and double majoring in Aritificial Intelligence and Mathematics with a minor in Acting at MIT takes a lot of my time.
                    I made this website with the intention to practice my web development skills and have a professional portfolio, but to be honest I kinda just like writing down my thoughts on this code editor
                    and seeing it appear all pretty on the website. Haha</p>
